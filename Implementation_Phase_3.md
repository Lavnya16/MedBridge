# **ðŸ’¡ Phase 3: Advanced Automation and Expansion**

This document details the final phase, focusing on system enhancements, advanced user features (Appointment Booking), and upgrading the rule-based AI module for future scalability.

## **1\. Appointment Booking & Real-Time Availability**

This module introduces direct patient interaction for scheduling, which is key to streamlining the patient experience.

| Servlet / Logic | Role | Key Functionality |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **AppointmentServlet** | Patient/System | **POST:** Receives desired doctor, specialization, and time slot. Checks the Doctor\_Schedule table for real-time availability. **Transaction handling** is mandatory here to prevent double-booking. |
| **DoctorScheduleServlet** | Doctor | **POST/PUT:** Allows doctors to update their working hours, block time slots, and set availability for online booking. |
| **Real-Time View (AJAX)** | Patient | Uses an AJAX-driven interface to dynamically show only the *available* appointment slots for a selected doctor/specialization. |
| **Data Layer** | Database | Requires a new **Appointment** table (appointment\_id (PK), patient\_id (FK), doctor\_id (FK), date\_time, status). |

## **2\. Advanced Analytics & Reporting Module**

Upgrading the **Report Module** to provide actionable intelligence for hospital administrators (Store Officers/Admins).

| Servlet / Logic | Role | Key Functionality |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **AnalyticsServlet** | Admin/Store Officer | **GET:** Queries database views to calculate high-level metrics. Uses Java to structure the data for presentation. |
| **Low Stock Forecasting** | Java Logic | Implements logic to analyze historical dispensing data from the Inventory Module to project future monthly medicine consumption and suggest purchase needs. |
| **Administrative Dashboard** | Admin | Presents charts/tables (rendered using JavaScript libraries like Chart.js on the frontend) showing **monthly usage trends**, **most prescribed medicines**, and **staff workload**. |
| **Employee Billing Report** | Report Module | Generates detailed medical billing reports based on patient-staff interactions and prescription costs. |

## **3\. Future AI Module Enhancement (Conceptual Upgrade)**

This step involves laying the groundwork for transitioning the current simple rule-based system toward a modern AI model, fulfilling a key "Future Enhancement" goal.

| Component | Task Detail | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **ML Data Prep** | Identify and extract a structured dataset of user queries and successful rule-based responses from the logged interaction history (if audit logs were created in Phase 2). | This data is crucial for training a future **NLP model** to understand varied language and improve suggestions. |
| **API Abstraction Layer** | Refactor the ChatbotLogic.java class to conform to a standard interface (e.g., IChatbotService). | This allows for seamless replacement of the rule-based implementation with a future **ML-powered API call** without modifying the front-end or ChatServlet. |
| **Future Push Notification Hook** | Create a simple Java utility class (NotificationService.java) that logs mock SMS/Email actions. | This acts as a placeholder hook to trigger notifications for appointments or prescriptions, ready for integration with external APIs (like Twilio or JavaMail) in a maintenance phase. |
